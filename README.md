# Traefik Local SSL

Want to use a signed and trusted cert for local development? We do too! This repo adds an entrypoint to the `traefik:alpine` image that will clone a repo containing a cert (most likely provisioned through LetsEncrypt) and use it for SSL. That way, there's no more self-signed certs you need to trust!

A blog post will be coming soon! A link will be posted here soon!
